# Blog-Application-Backend
The backend project in Spring Boot for a blog application includes real-time REST APIs that enable seamless communication between the front-end and the back-end. The database used for this project is _MySQL_, which is a popular choice for web-based applications.

The REST APIs implemented in this project are secured using _Spring Security_, which is a powerful and customizable framework for authentication and authorization. Role-based authentication is also implemented, which allows for different levels of access based on user roles.

_Pagination and sorting_ are implemented in the project, which makes it easier to navigate and filter through large amounts of data. _JWT tokens_ are used for login and signup, which provides a secure and efficient way of managing user authentication.

_Exception handling and validation_ are also implemented in the project, which ensures that any errors or invalid data inputs are caught and handled appropriately. This ensures that the application runs smoothly and is able to handle unexpected situations.

Overall, the project is designed to provide a reliable and secure back-end for a blog application, with efficient communication between the front-end and the back-end, and a strong emphasis on security and data validation.
